# Rent_Control_Research
This repository provides a pipeline to consolidate a decade of weekly real estate snapshots (2014–2024) into a unified dataset. The code automates file discovery, extracts dates from filenames via regex, and merges CSVs into a master panel. It then normalizes addresses and attributes to create stable IDs for tracking specific rental units over time
